Description: Simultaneously collects profiling data at both the R and C/C++
    levels (using 'Rprof' and Google's 'libprofiler' from 'gperftools') and
    collates the results to present a unified view of the collected data.
    Supports writing these combined profiles to R's usual 'Rprof.out' format (for
    interoperability with existing tools) or interacting with the external
    'pprof' program for its rich visualization tools.
